# 🤖 GPT-4 Smart Chatbot for Customer Service

This project demonstrates how to build a custom, business-specific chatbot using GPT-4 via the OpenAI API. Designed for small business customer service, the chatbot can understand, engage, and respond naturally to user queries—far beyond the limitations of rule-based bots.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- 💬 Build a GPT-based chatbot tailored for small businesses
- 📄 Use business-specific data to fine-tune chatbot behavior
- ⚖️ Compare LLM-driven responses to traditional rule-based systems
- 🛠️ Deploy a lightweight chatbot API using Flask
